# Chapter 4 Exercises
Each chapter includes one mandatory and one bonus exercise. The mandatory exercise is indicated with a :ballot_box_with_check: and must be completed as part of the Set Exercises assessment. The bonus exercise is optional but completing it opens up the possibility of achieving a grade in the higher mark boundaries.

For each exercise you should create a new folder with the name of the exercise and save it to this exercises folder in your local repository. Once you have completed your solution you should make sure you commit and push your work to GitHub. You can commit and push as many changes to your solutions as you wish; only those pushed before the deadlines will be marked.

## Assessment Exercises

### Structuring a webpage :ballot_box_with_check:

Using the website reference image below, code this website (focussing on proper structural markup). Your work doesn't need to be exact in attempting to recreate the padding, margins etc., but you do need to recreate the layout of the page exactly, using the structural elements you've been taught. You must include:

- Header;
- Navigation menu;
- The main "Welcome" content;
- "Line Up" content, including two square images underneath the text;
- Footer;
- index.html and style.css files.

These tags might come in useful: `<header>` `<nav>` `<main>` `<section>` `<article>` `<div>` `<aside>` `<footer>`

- Logo and Heading font: "Tahoma", 700 (Apple users, you may have a tad bit more work to do here)
- Body font: "Arial", 400
- Header: #17072b
- Sidebar: #172d67
- Footer: #8c15e9
- Text: #000000 and #FFFFFF
