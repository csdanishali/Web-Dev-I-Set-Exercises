# Web Development

Web Development - CCO4001-20

## Module Overview

The web is rapidly becoming the go-to environment for deploying and using software. We rely on web technologies to manage our work and social lives, collaborate with like-minded people, experience art and be entertained. Anyone entering the field of computing should have at least a basic understanding of web development, and be able to identify the key opportunities and limitations that web-based software presents.

This module focuses on the creation of online interactive experiences. You learn the key languages of web development (HTML5, CSS, JavaScript) - gaining a practical understanding of how they handle content structure/styling and user interactivity. We assume little to no prior experience of web development. You learn from the ground up, working through coding challenges and creative briefs that help embed new techniques and best practice into your programming ‘toolkit’.

Topics covered include:

* Text
* Images
* CSS Styling
* Audio, Video & Embedded Content
* Structure and Semantic Markup
* Navigation
* CSS Animation
* JavaScript Basics
* HTML5 Canvas Basics
* Coding Conventions and Troubleshooting

## Expectations

* You will work outside of your timetabled sessions to constantly improve your skills. This module is designed to lead you towards independent research and experimentation, as you will continually have to do this as a developer.

* The group will begin to develop a sense of working together as a team, just as an agency would. Coding is easier when you’re prepared to ask for help, and give help. No one gets left behind.

* You accept that web development is difficult and that feeling of “being stuck” is where most of the work happens.

## Breadth of Ability

The teaching of this module assumes little to no prior experience of web development. However, we accept that some students may already be well read in the field. If you already feel confident with web development we encourage you to begin acting as a senior developer... Actively contribute to sessions, help others and share your knowledge with the class. Most companies hire based on whether you will fit with the culture of the team and the earlier you can develop an understanding of how to contribute to culture, the better.

## Setting up an IDE

Class demonstrations are taught using VS code. If you are using your own laptop you can use any IDE you like, or download VS Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/download. It is important that you spend time setting up your own development environment. You should be able to easily retrieve code produced in previous lectures as we'll often be returning to past examples to improve them.

## Repository Contents

### Chapter Exercises

Each chapter includes exercises that are designed to help put what you learn in theoretical lectures into practice. These exercises form the entirity of your "Set Exercises" assessment which contributes to 40% of your final module grade. You should aim to work through these exercises in order. Exercises with a tick mark included under the heading Assessment Exercises represent exercises that must be submitted as part of your Set Excersises assessment, as a bare minimum expectation. Bonus exercises are also included to give you the opportunity to gain higher marks. Nearer to the submission date of your Set Exercises assessment, you will be given access to a subsequent set of chapters which will reflect the learning you will undertake to complete your final assessment (Canvas API etc.), these chapters will not form part of your Set Exercises assessment. 

To complete the exercises:

* First make sure you have cloned this repository to your local machine;
* Create a separate project for each exercise in the corresponding chapter's exercise folder;
* When happy with your solution commit and push your changes back to Github;

### Reading Lists

Each chapter includes a 'Reading List' which includes a variety of resources to help cement your understanding of web development. In some instances you will find gaps in the information provided as a way of encouraging you to learn how to find resources yourself (a fundamental developer skill). If you ever find yourself struggling to find information your lecturer will be able to assist you.
